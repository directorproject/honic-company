## Background & History

HonicLearn was established to address a major gap in Tanzania's education system, where learning remains heavily theory-based due to limited access to practical learning tools. Many schools face shortages of laboratory equipment, training kits, and hands-on instructional materials, making it challenging for students to acquire practical skills, particularly in Science, Engineering, and Technology.

Recognizing this challenge, Honic Company Limited, an innovation-driven organization focused on product development, initiated HonicLearn as a dedicated education innovation department. Its goal is to design and locally manufacture curriculum-aligned, inclusive, high-quality practical learning tools with a strong focus on skills-based development, enabling students to actively engage in learning and apply knowledge in real-world contexts.

Officially established on **1st March 2025**, HonicLearn promotes hands-on, skills-based learning in line with the Tanzania Education and Training Policy (ETP) 2014, 2023 Edition (Elimu Amali). Our approach prepares students for practical problem-solving, innovation, and future employment. Since its inception, HonicLearn has collaborated with educational institutions, suppliers, and local partners to deliver practical STEM learning kits, conduct technical workshops, and enhance schools' capacity for hands-on education across Tanzania.
